      <h1 class="text-3xl font-extrabold font-sans mb-4 tracking-tight">Why Netflix’s “No Vacation Policy” Works</h1>
      <p class="font-serif text-lg leading-relaxed tracking-wide mb-4">
        <strong>Based on the book <em>No Rules Rules</em> by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-6 mb-2 tracking-tight">What is Netflix’s “No Vacation Policy”?</h3>
      <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Netflix doesn’t have fixed vacation days. Employees are free to take time off whenever they feel it’s right as long as they’re getting their work done.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-6 mb-2 tracking-tight">How does it work, and why is it important?</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 font-sans text-base">
        <li><strong>Trust, not tracking:</strong> Netflix trusts employees to take responsibility for their own time.</li>
        <li><strong>Better performance:</strong> When people rest when they need to, they come back more focused, creative, and motivated.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-6 mb-2 tracking-tight">What helps make this policy successful?</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 font-sans text-base">
        <li><strong>High-performing teams:</strong> Netflix only hires top talent. These employees are self-driven and don’t misuse this freedom.</li>
        <li><strong>Open feedback culture:</strong> If someone isn’t using or managing their time well, others give honest feedback to help them improve quickly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-6 mb-2 tracking-tight">Why does this work at Netflix but not in most companies?</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 font-sans text-base">
        <li>Netflix has strong, responsible people and a culture where everyone speaks openly.</li>
        <li>In many companies, employees don’t feel safe to take time off or give/receive honest feedback.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-6 mb-2 tracking-tight">What’s the situation like in India?</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 font-sans text-base">
        <li><strong>Fear of taking leave:</strong> 35–40% of Indian employees avoid taking leave because they’re afraid of missing out or being judged.</li>
        <li><strong>Feeling overworked:</strong> A 2018 survey found 75% of Indians feel they don’t get enough vacation, even if they’re allowed to take it.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-6 mb-2 tracking-tight">Resources:</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 font-sans text-base">
        <li><a href="https://lnkd.in/dyMniPmq" class="text-purple-600 underline font-medium hover:text-purple-800 transition-colors" target="_blank">LinkedIn Article 1</a></li>

      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-6 mb-2 tracking-tight">Why is it hard to apply this policy in India?</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 font-sans text-base">
        <li>People are often expected to always be available.</li>
        <li>Managers care more about how many hours you work, not the results.</li>
        <li>There’s fear that taking too much time off will hurt your career.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-6 mb-2 tracking-tight">What can go wrong with this policy?</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 font-sans text-base">
        <li>If leaders don’t take leave themselves, employees might feel guilty about taking time off.</li>
        <li>Some people might misuse the policy if no one gives honest feedback.</li>
        <li>It can cause problems if a few people take too much leave while others have to cover for them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-6 mb-2 tracking-tight">Indian Companies That Adopted This:</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 font-sans text-base">
        <li><strong>Myntra:</strong> Offers unlimited wellness leaves for mental and physical health.</li>
        <li><strong>MakeMyTrip:</strong> Offers unlimited leave with mandatory paid time off.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-6 mb-2 tracking-tight">Final Thought</h3>
      <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mt-2">
        Netflix’s no-vacation-policy works because it’s backed by trust, great people, and clear feedback. For other companies to try something similar, they must first build a culture of honesty, high performance, and freedom with responsibility.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-6 italic text-gray-600 font-serif text-base">
        Next question: how can we apply this in an organization with lower talent density?

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-extrabold font-sans mb-4 tracking-tight">Leadership means "Breaking Barriers"</h1>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Many people assume leadership is about how hard you work. Long hours, dedication, and persistence certainly matter but effort alone doesn’t equal great leadership. What truly sets leaders apart is <strong>ownership</strong>: fully embracing responsibility for the success of their team, the obstacles in their way, and the direction they’re headed.
    </p>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Imagine a team working tirelessly but still falling short because the right tools or resources aren’t in place. As a manager, you might raise concerns, suggest improvements, or adapt within the boundaries given. But here’s the catch: if the team doesn’t deliver, the world won’t ask about the lack of resources. They’ll want to know who was accountable. And accountability always lands at the leader’s desk.
    </p>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Leadership brings with it an expectation: not just to keep things running, but to challenge systems, raise your voice when something isn’t working, secure what your team truly needs, and fight for solutions even when it’s uncomfortable.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-8 mb-2 tracking-tight">The Two Faces of Leadership: Execution and Advocacy</h3>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Leadership lives at the intersection of two demanding roles: <strong>execution</strong> and <strong>advocacy</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      <strong>Execution</strong> is managing what’s in front of you — coordinating tasks, aligning people, and hitting targets. <strong>Advocacy</strong> is challenging broken processes, pushing for better tools, and reshaping what’s possible for your team.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-8 mb-2 tracking-tight">The Discomfort That Defines Leadership</h3>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      The hardest parts of leadership are rarely the tasks they’re the uncomfortable conversations and the repeated requests that test your patience. Asking once is easy. Asking three or four times, even when ignored, is where your commitment is truly tested.
    </p>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      That persistence, that willingness to embrace discomfort, is what separates passive managers from transformative leaders.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 italic text-gray-600 font-serif text-base">
      A manager sustains momentum. A leader redefines what’s possible.

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      A few days ago, I stumbled upon a meme that made me think about something important. It hit me differently because I had just lived that exact experience during a coding session with ChatGPT.
    </p>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      I was working on a machine learning project. I asked ChatGPT for help with an error, and it added a random line that had absolutely nothing to do with my query. It didn’t break my output. It didn’t throw an error. It just sat there like that one project partner who contributes absolutely nothing in a group project.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-purple-500 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-4">“Hawk-eyed! You’re right. Let me change it.”</blockquote>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      I stared at the screen, sipping my coffee, thinking, “So this is what artificial intelligence looks like?”
    </p>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Don’t get me wrong AI is incredible. It has saved me hours of debugging, helped me brainstorm logic, and even taught me new ways to structure my code. But that small, harmless line of code made me realize something much bigger.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-8 mb-2 tracking-tight">What if a tiny error becomes a big problem?</h3>
    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      In coding, a random useless line might not always cause harm. Sometimes, it just slows things down or makes your code messy. But in the real world, where AI is used to diagnose diseases, manage finances, or drive cars, even a tiny mistake can cause massive consequences.
    </p>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      The scary part? AI won’t feel bad about it. It won’t lose sleep or second-guess itself. It’ll move on learning from the error but the harm might already be done.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-8 mb-2 tracking-tight">Why Understanding the Domain Still Matters</h3>
    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Let’s be honest AI is like that business consultant who always thinks they’re right. They speak with such confidence that you start doubting yourself. But if you don’t understand the domain be it coding, medicine, or marketing you won’t even know if AI’s response is right or wrong.
    </p>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      That’s dangerous. AI is trained on patterns. It doesn’t understand context, nuance, or consequences. Blind reliance on AI is like handing your car keys to someone who’s read every driving manual but never driven. And that never ends well unless you’re Max Verstappen.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-8 mb-2 tracking-tight">AI Won’t Replace You, But Someone Who Knows How to Use It Might</h3>
    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      “Will AI replace humans?” The short answer is no. The long answer? It depends on how you use it.
    </p>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      AI won’t replace a great coder but a mediocre coder who uses AI efficiently might replace a great one who refuses to adapt. The same goes for writers, designers, and marketers.
    </p>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      AI is a tool, not a replacement. It improves what you already know. Without fundamentals, AI will confuse you when complexity hits. That’s when the basics matter most.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-8 mb-2 tracking-tight">The New Skill Everyone Needs: AI Literacy</h3>
    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      We talk about digital literacy, financial literacy, emotional intelligence but now, <strong>AI literacy</strong> matters just as much. It’s not about coding your own model. It’s about understanding how AI works, where it gets data from, and what its limits are.
    </p>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Once you understand that, you stop being a passive user you become an active collaborator. That’s where real innovation happens.
    </p>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      After that incident, I didn’t just fix my code I fixed my mindset. I stopped treating AI as a genius and started treating it like a smart intern fast, eager, but still needs supervision.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-sans mt-8 mb-2 tracking-tight">Final Thoughts: The Human in the Loop</h3>
    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      AI will evolve. It’ll become smarter, faster, more capable but it’ll never replace human judgment. AI can process data, but not meaning. It can mimic emotion, but not responsibility.
    </p>

    <p class="font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      So the next time AI gives you a random answer, smile, sip your coffee, and remind yourself you’re still the captain of the ship.
    </p>

    <p class="italic text-gray-600 mt-4">
      Because at the end of the day, AI won’t replace humans it’ll replace those who stopped learning.
