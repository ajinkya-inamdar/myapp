      <p><strong>Based on the book <em>No Rules Rules</em> by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer.</strong></p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">What is Netflix’s “No Vacation Policy”?</h3>
      <p>Netflix doesn’t have fixed vacation days. Employees are free to take time off whenever they feel it’s right as long as they’re getting their work done.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">How does it work, and why is it important?</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li><strong>Trust, not tracking:</strong> Netflix trusts employees to take responsibility for their own time.</li>
        <li><strong>Better performance:</strong> When people rest when they need to, they come back more focused, creative, and motivated.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">What helps make this policy successful?</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li><strong>High-performing teams:</strong> Netflix only hires top talent. These employees are self-driven and don’t misuse this freedom.</li>
        <li><strong>Open feedback culture:</strong> If someone isn’t using or managing their time well, others give honest feedback to help them improve quickly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Why does this work at Netflix but not in most companies?</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Netflix has strong, responsible people and a culture where everyone speaks openly.</li>
        <li>In many companies, employees don’t feel safe to take time off or give/receive honest feedback.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">What’s the situation like in India?</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li><strong>Fear of taking leave:</strong> 35–40% of Indian employees avoid taking leave because they’re afraid of missing out or being judged.</li>
        <li><strong>Feeling overworked:</strong> A 2018 survey found 75% of Indians feel they don’t get enough vacation, even if they’re allowed to take it.</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Why is it hard to apply this policy in India?</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>People are often expected to always be available.</li>
        <li>Managers care more about how many hours you work, not the results.</li>
        <li>There’s fear that taking too much time off will hurt your career.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">What can go wrong with this policy?</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>If leaders don’t take leave themselves, employees might feel guilty about taking time off.</li>
        <li>Some people might misuse the policy if no one gives honest feedback.</li>
        <li>It can cause problems if a few people take too much leave while others have to cover for them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Indian Companies That Adopted This:</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li><strong>Myntra:</strong> Offers unlimited wellness leaves for mental and physical health.</li>
        <li><strong>MakeMyTrip:</strong> Offers unlimited leave with mandatory paid time off.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Final Thought</h3>
      <p>Netflix’s no-vacation-policy works because it’s backed by trust, great people, and clear feedback. For other companies to try something similar, they must first build a culture of honesty, high performance, and freedom with responsibility.</p>

      <p class="mt-6 italic text-gray-600">Next question: how can we apply this in an organization with lower talent density?</p>
